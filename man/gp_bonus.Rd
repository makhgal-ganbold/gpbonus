\title{Compute New Grade Points with Bonus}
\usage{
gp_bonus(gp, max.bonus = 15, min.bonus = 0, threshold = 90)
}
\arguments{
\item{gp}{a vector; student grade points}

\item{max.bonus}{a positive numeric; the upper bound of the bonus point}

\item{min.bonus}{a non-negative numeric; lower bound of the bonus point}

\item{threshold}{a positive numeric; the upper bound of grade points with bonus}
}
\value{
list; new and old grade points, a bonus point
}
\description{
Computes student grade points with a bonus by minimizing the absolute difference between the fixed significant level 0.05 and a p-value of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test compares a distribution of grade points with the fixed normal distribution.
}
\details{
It doesn't increase grade points to be lower than 60 with the bonus points.

Grade points, which are greater than the \code{threshold}, won't be changed. Also, it won't increase grade points over the upper limit is defined by the parameter \code{threshold}.

## Example 1
gp <- c(43, 72, 88, 60, 77, 51, 69, 61, 60, 86, 65)
gpbonus::gp_bonus(gp)

## Example 2
gp <- c(72, "E", 51, 69, "WF", 81, 61, 75, 54, "W")
gpbonus::gp_bonus(gp, max.bonus = 30, threshold = Inf)
